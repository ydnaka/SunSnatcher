# Sun Snatcher

This project is a 3D puzzle platformer game based on the obscure Super Famicom game [Sutte Hakkun](https://youtu.be/SAq1BnxuQDY). The original game can get quite complex in later stages, so we will only implement the most basic features of the game.

### Getting started:

To set up the project, you need to have Node.js, npm, Three.js, and vite already installed.

All you need to do is:
1. Open your terminal/CMD and change working directory to the project directory
